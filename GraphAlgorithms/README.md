The graph data structure is a relational structure where many elements (referred to as nodes or vertices) can be connected to each other. A graph is a model that represents the relationships between nodes or vertices (referred to as edges or links).

The graph data structure is used to model various real-world scenarios. For example, it can be used to represent relationships between users in a social network, connections between web pages in a network, or the network of roads in a city.

The graph data structure generally comes in two basic types:

Undirected Graph: In this type of graph, edges can have any direction. Edges represent the relationship between two nodes, but do not indicate a direction. For example, it can be used to represent friendships.

Directed Graph: In this type of graph, edges have a direction. Typically, edges are directed from a starting node to a target node. For example, it can be used to represent links on a website.

The graph data structure is used to solve various algorithms and problems in graph theory. For example, graph algorithms such as finding the shortest path, depth-first search, breadth-first search, etc., are based on the graph data structure.

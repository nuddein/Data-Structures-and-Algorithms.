Data Structure


Data structure is a struct or organization that enables data to be stored, managed, and accessed in a specific manner. Essentially, 
data structures determine how data is organized and accessed, facilitating more efficient data processing and management.

Data structures allow various operations (such as insertion, deletion, search, sorting, etc.) to be performed quickly and effectively.
 Additionally, data structures are typically designed to optimize memory usage, minimizing the cost of data storage and access.




Queue

A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that supports adding items to the back (enqueue) and removing items from the front (dequeue).
 Queues are commonly used in scenarios where items are processed in the order they arrive, such as task scheduling or handling web server requests.

Stack

A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure where only the topmost item can be accessed.
 Stacks allow for simple addition (push) and removal (pop) operations,
 making them useful for managing data in a specific order, 
such as managing function calls in a text editor or implementing undo-redo functionality.



Linked List


Linked list is another linear data structure consisting of elements called nodes. 
Each node stores a data item and a reference (pointer) to the next node. 
Linked lists can easily expand and contract, allowing dynamic memory allocation,
 but this comes at the expense of slower item access compared to arrays.
